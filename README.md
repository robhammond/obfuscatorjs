## Synopsis

Node / Express powered web traffic obscuring. Protect your privacy against governments & companies by mixing it in with a headless Chrome instance that mimics a real user browsing the web.

## Code Example

Start the obfuscator:

```
node bin/obfuscate.js
```

## Motivation

Under the [Investigatory Powers Act](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/ip-bill-law-details-passed), every ISP must store your web browsing history for 12 months. The effects of this on individual privacy are chilling, and this project aims to make that data less useful to governments and hackers through obscuring real browsing traffic amongst random, but directed automated traffic.

## Installation

```
npm install
```
